		<h1> About Me </h1>

		<h2>Profile</h2>

		<h2>Interesting Experience with Web Development</h2>
		<p>
			Prior to taking computer science as my major, I picked up a book
			that taught me how to make a simple website from scratch. I think
			that was my only experience with web development, and I did that
			years ago so it has been a while.
		</p>

		<h2>Hopes from This Class</h2>
		<p>
			I am hoping to gain some web development skills, and expand my
			programming skills more. Lately, I've also been thinking to focus
			in web and app development, so I am taking this class as my chance
			to know if I'll actually want to focus in it.

		<h2>An Interesting Fact About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Growing up, my parents wanted their children to be able to play at
			least one music instrument. I was a very picky kid and I tend to grow
			bored playing an instrument. So, I ended up learning how to play
			guitar, piano, drums, violin, and ukulele. I ended up loving how
			to play guitar and ukulele the most though.
