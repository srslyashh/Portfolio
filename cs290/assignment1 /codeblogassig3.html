		<h2>Assignment 3</h2>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>I was having a hard time with the modal at first, it was hard for me
				 to open up the button. What helped me was looking up how to unhide a class
			   on stackoverflow.</li>
				<li>I was very confused on how to make the twit boxes go and reappear again
				for the search input. But I managed to understand by reading the notes and
				watching the lectures.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New Things Learnt</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I learnt a lot of new things from this assignment! I have never learnt
			JavaScript before and this was a new experience. I really felt overwhelmed
		for this assignment as i did not know that  much, but i'll put in more work
			and  study  more.</li>
			<li>I think Javascript is very different compared to the other languages
			I've learnt. It is very simplified that it's kind of confusing sometimes,
		because things would be done differently in other languages like C.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For me, the lectures are my still go-to resource.</li>
			<li>I also like to read from stackoverflow and see people who might have
			had the same issues as me.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What Did I Have to Google?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I had to google how to unhide the hidden classes.</li>
			<li>I also had to google querySelectorAll and how to implement it to
			this assignment.</li>
			<li>I also looked up insertBefore() for the search function and adding
			the boxes back to where it belongs.</li>
		</ul>
