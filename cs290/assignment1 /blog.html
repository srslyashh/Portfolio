		<h2> Assignment 1 </h2>
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>At the beginning, I was struggling to insert the picture into
			index.html. It just gave me a small blue icon and the image didn't
			pop up. However, I solved that issue by using a link  that only leads
			to the image.</li>
			<li>This is my first time using GitHub, so it was quite a challenge.
			But after watching the lectures and the notes, I was able to get it to
			work. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New Things Learnt and Previous Knowledge</h3>

		<h3>Things I Gained From This Assignment</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I learnt about block and inline.</li>
			<li>I have never thought about how some things are coded in certain ways
			so that people with visual impairment could use a tool to read the text
			without missing out what's being talked about.</li>
			<li>Another I learnt was how to change the permission for others to read
			and execute the files through the engineering server.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Previous Knowledge</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Although I learnt html a few years ago, I still remembered things such
				as h1,h2, and etc.</li>
			<li>I just remembered basic things like mentioned in the previous point,
			but I never understood why things were done in some ways.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
		<p>
			I think some of the helpful resources for this assignment were the
			lectures and the lecture notes. I learnt a lot through the lectures and
			appreciated how things were explained in details. It felt as if we had
			all the information needed for the assignment. I also read the posts
			in Campuswire before working on this assignment. It  helped and gave me a
			heads up of what was to be expected.
		</p>

		<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>I was having a hard time with the icons, because I didn't know
				how to make them look bigger or change the background color. But then
				I tried changing the background color and I looked up on Google how to
				change icon colors.</li>
				<li>I was also confused on how to arrange the navigation bar, especially
				with the search box on the right. Then I watched the lecture from 4/22
			 	and it really helped me understand.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New Things Learnt</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I learnt a lot of things from this assignment, especially because
			I have never learnt CSS before. It was interesting to see how a website
			is designed!</li>
			<li>Before this assignment, I really didn't know much about CSS. So
			everything was new to me.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I found the lectures really helpful! I felt like Professor Rob really
			explained things in details, and that was very helpful for me.</li>
			<li>Another thing I found helpful was stackoverflow, since I am a beginner
			in CSS, there were some things I didn't know of like how to add space
			before and after an element.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What Did I Have to Google?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I had to google a few things, such as how to add space before an
			after an element since it was not accepting " ".</li>
			<li>I didn't know how to resize an icon so I had to google that. I tried
			changing the width and height but it didn't work.</li>
			<li>I wanted to search the opposite of :focus, for the search bar, so I
			googled it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Assignment 3</h2>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>I was having a hard time with the modal at first, it was hard for me
				 to open up the button. What helped me was looking up how to unhide a class
			   on stackoverflow.</li>
				<li>I was very confused on how to make the twit boxes go and reappear again
				for the search input. But I managed to understand by reading the notes and
				watching the lectures.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New Things Learnt</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I learnt a lot of new things from this assignment! I have never learnt
			JavaScript before and this was a new experience. I really felt overwhelmed
		for this assignment as i did not know that  much, but i'll put in more work
			and  study  more.</li>
			<li>I think Javascript is very different compared to the other languages
			I've learnt. It is very simplified that it's kind of confusing sometimes,
		because things would be done differently in other languages like C.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Helpful Resources</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For me, the lectures are my still go-to resource.</li>
			<li>I also like to read from stackoverflow and see people who might have
			had the same issues as me.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> What Did I Have to Google? </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I had to google how to unhide the hidden classes.</li>
			<li>I also had to google querySelectorAll and how to implement it to
			this assignment.</li>
			<li>I also looked up insertBefore() for the search function and adding
			the boxes back to where it belongs.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Assignment 4</h2>

		<h3>Challenges</h3>

				giving me an error until I realized that I had to set the res.status
				before I write the data.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New Things Learnt</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I learnt some new stuff from this assignment, since this is new to me
			and I have never done anything mentioned in the lectures before.</li>

			it was pretty fun to get to know that.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>For me, Rob's lectures are very thorough and explains the assignment
			very well. It was helpful for me to understand what  to do.</li>
			<li>For this assignment, I didn't really use stackoverflow. I just wrote
			down notes during the lectures and found them very helpful.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> What Did I Have to Google? </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>At first I thought writing data for css/js might be different,
			so I tried to google that. But turned out I had just mixed up the formation
			of some things in my code.</li>
			<li>I also had to google readFileSync and the syntax to ensure I got it
			right.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
