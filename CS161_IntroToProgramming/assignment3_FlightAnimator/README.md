# Flight Animator
###### CS 161 - Winter 2020 at Oregon State University

## Description

This program calculates how long a flight will take and flight cost per person due to fuel burned after receiving information regarding the planned airplane flight (distance, airspeed, wind conditions, price of fuel per gallon and the number of passengers).
The program will also display an animation of the outbound flight in which 1 second of animation equals to 1 hour of flying time. The program will do the same computation and animation for the return flight, in which the wind has the opposite effect (a headwind becomes a tailwind and vice versa).

## Command
To run the program, run: 

      g++ assignment3.cpp
      
Then, run:
  
      ./a.out

## Requirements

- Use loops to avoid code duplication
- Use functions to define re-usable modules of code. Must have at least 3 functions to calculate flight duration, calculate flight cost per passenger, and output flight animation.
- At least 1 function should specify a default value for at least 1 parameter.
- Check all user inputs and handle invalid inputs gracefully
- No use of global variables
