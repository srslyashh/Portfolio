    CITATION: 
================
    1. The lecture Process API - Monitoring Child Processes helped me understand 
       the concept about checking child processes

    2. The lecture Processes and I/O helped in creating this function. 
        dup2() and how we could redirect the stdin and stdout was also
        learnt from that lecture.
    
    3. Monitoring Child Processes really helped in inspiring me to make the 
       forkFunc(). The code example included in that lecture especially helped.
